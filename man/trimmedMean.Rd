\title{Trimmed Arithmetic Mean Score}
\usage{
trimmedMean(x, trim = 0, i = NULL, na.rm = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an \R object.  Currently there are methods for
    numeric/logical vectors and \link[base:Dates]{date},
    \link[base]{date-time} and \link[base]{time interval} objects.  Complex vectors
    are allowed for \code{trim = 0}, only.}

\item{trim}{the fraction (0 to 0.5) of observations to be
    trimmed from each end of \code{x} before the mean is computed.
    Values of trim outside that range are taken as the nearest endpoint.
  }

\item{i}{(optional) numerical vector giving the position in \code{x}
or character vector matching the names in \code{x}.
If \code{missing} or \code{i = NULL}, the entire \code{x} is
considered for the computation of the score}

\item{na.rm}{a logical evaluating to \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}
    indicating whether \code{NA} values should be stripped before the
    computation proceeds.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
If \code{trim} is zero (the default), the arithmetic mean of the
  values in \code{x} is computed, as a numeric or complex vector of
  length one.  If \code{x} is not logical (coerced to numeric), numeric
  (including integer) or complex, \code{NA_real_} is returned, with a warning.

  If \code{trim} is non-zero, a symmetrically trimmed mean is computed
  with a fraction of \code{trim} observations deleted from each end
  before the mean is computed.
}
\description{
This function computes the \emph{trimmed arithmetic mean}
using \code{\link[base]{mean}}.
}
\details{
It is a wrapper to \code{\link[base]{mean}}
function.

x = c(seq_len(length.out = 10), NA)
