\title{Achieved Significance Level (ASL)}
\usage{
computeASL(obs, rnd, alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"))
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{a numeric scalar representing the observed value of the summary statistic.}

\item{rnd}{numerical vector containing the permutation/bootstrap
replication of the statistics.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the
alternative hypothesis. Must be one of \code{"two.sided"} (default),
\code{"greater"} or \code{"less"}.}
}
\value{
A numerical value representing the approximate
achieved significance level (ASL) of the test.
}
\description{
This function computes the approximate
achieved significance level (ASL) for a permutation
test or bootstrap hypothesis test.
}
\details{
It is computed as:

\deqn{\hat{ASL}_{sample}(x) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}  {\hat{\theta}_{i}}^{*} \ge \hat{\theta}}

where \eqn{\hat{\theta}} is a summary statistic; \eqn{{\hat{\theta}}^{*}}
is the permutation/bootstrap distribution of \eqn{\hat{\theta}};
\eqn{{\hat{\theta}_{i}}^{*}} is the computed statistic on the
\eqn{i}-th permutation/bootstrap vector.

\eqn{\hat{\theta}} is observed, and the ASL of the test
represents the probability of observing at least that large
a value when the null hypothesis is true.
