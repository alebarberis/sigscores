\title{Percentile Confidence Interval}
\usage{
computePercentileCI(rnd, conf.level = 0.95, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{rnd}{a numeric vector containing the bootstrap or permutation
replications of the summary statistic.}

\item{conf.level}{a numeric scalar between 0 and 1 specifying the desired
confidence level. Defaults to 0.95.}

\item{na.rm}{logical. Should missing values be removed before computing quantiles?
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector with two elements:
\code{lower} and \code{upper}, corresponding to the lower and upper
bounds of the percentile confidence interval.
}
\description{
Computes a percentile-based confidence interval for a summary statistic,
based on a vector of bootstrap or permutation replicates.
}
\details{
The percentile confidence interval is defined by taking the
\eqn{\alpha/2} and \eqn{1 - \alpha/2} quantiles of the bootstrap
distribution, where \eqn{\alpha = 1 - \text{conf.level}}.

This method does not rely on the symmetry or normality of the
sampling distribution and is often used in bootstrap analysis.
